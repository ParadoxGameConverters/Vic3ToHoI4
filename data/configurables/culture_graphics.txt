# A Vic3 culture will find the most specific match it can.
# First, it wil match on culture.
# Second, if its culture name is not present in any entry, it will match based on cultural traits.
# Third, if the traits find no matches, it'll match based on ethnicity.
#
# If the Vic3 culture finds multiple matches of the same precendance, it will use the union of both portrait sets.
# For example: Sephardim has both European and Middle-Eastern Heritage. If no portrait group explicitly has Sephardim,
# Sephardim will use both European and Middle-Eastern graphics.
