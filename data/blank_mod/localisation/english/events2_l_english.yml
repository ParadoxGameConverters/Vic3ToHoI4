 communism_on_the_rise.d:0 "'While workers rise up against their oppressors around the world, those who claim to have achieved class consciousness in [Root.GetName] sit idly by and wait for change to come from within a political system so thoroughly corrupt, only revolution could save us from it!'\n\nSo speak new voices in the [Root.GetAdjective] communist movement. Referring to the rule of [Root.GetRulingParty] as a dictatorship of the bourgeois, they have begun calling for it to be brought out of power by any means necessary. Whether those means will come from within or without remains to be seen."
 communism_on_the_rise.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 communism_on_the_rise.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a communist coup."

 communism_ideological_sympathies.t:0 "Marxist Sympathies in Government"
 communism_ideological_sympathies.d:0 "Although the party line of the [Root.GetRulingParty] is to strongly oppose revolutionary socialism, keeping a watchful eye on the nation's radical left-wing elements, some people in government are more open to the possibility. If nothing else, they see room for addressing the concerns of the people who look to communists for solutions without risking a full-scale civil war.\n\nAlthough they may be seen as traitors by those who remain loyal to [Root.GetLeader], these dissident voices may be the ones to ensure a relatively bloodless transition should the revolution come."
 communism_ideological_sympathies.a:0 "We'll keep a close eye on them too, for many reasons."
 communism_ideological_sympathies.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 communism_coup.t:0 "Communists Execute Coup"
 communism_coup.d:0 "While the popular movement for communist revolution has been loud and terrifying, a certain section of the political movement has been largely quiet and waiting. The wait is now over. Today, just as the [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership and army were bracing for a revolt on national scale, a number of officials in the [Root.GetAdjective] government swiftly placed [Root.GetLeader] under house arrest and entered negotiations with the rebels.\n\nWhile retaining a pretense of safeguarding order, what the negotiations effectively amounted to was to secure positions within the new socialist state for those who chose to cooperate. The coup was finished before anyone could move to stop it, and those who would have are now imprisoned, exiled or executed by the new regime."
 communism_coup.a:0 "The tides of history will sweep away the past."
 communism_add_popularity.t:0 "Class Conflicts Divide [Root.GetName]"
 communism_add_popularity.d:0 "The communist revolutionary movement, once a fringe popular among radical academics in theory and troublemakers in practice, has seen increased support among the [Root.GetAdjective] working class. The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Marxist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."
 communism_add_popularity.a:0 "The people may call themselves whatever they want."
 communism_military_defections.t:0 "Soldiers Desert to Communist Partisans"
 communism_military_defections.d:0 "'Capitalists and nationalists would have you spill your blood for them on the front lines, turning brother against brother over disputes that do not concern the working man! Instead of taking up arms against workers who struggle abroad, raise them against the oppressors and overthrow the tyrants!'\n\nThe army, usually a bastion of patriotism and loyalty, has proven not to be immune to the communist propaganda spreading rapidly in [Root.GetName]. Soldiers are deserting, refusing to fight for their country, sometimes going as far as joining partisan movements that claim to be preparing for revolution."
 communism_military_defections.a:0 "Perhaps they are merely fighting for a different [Root.GetName]."
 communism_civil_war.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
 communism_civil_war.d:0 "The notion that the communist movement represents the people has certainly gotten wind in its sails in [Root.GetName], where the public support for the communist party has increased rapidly in the past months. But those who call for revolution are no longer a disparate collection of guerrillas and disgruntled labor unions. The group behind the call for revolt is organized enough to form a government if they succeed.\n\nNevertheless, if the revolution started now, it could hardly be executed without launching [Root.GetName] into civil war. Should the revolutionaries risk tearing the nation in two to satisfy their impatience, or wait for a better opportunity in the future?"
 communism_civil_war.a:0 "Those who wish to make history must act today!"
 communism_civil_war.b:0 "Revolution is inevitable. The inevitable can wait."

 fascism_on_the_rise.d:0 "'The [Root.GetAdjective] people have been subjected too long to the incompetent rule of [Root.GetRulingParty]! They claim to represent the people, but fail to even keep our streets in order! Only by removing them from power can we make this nation grow!'\n\nThe fascist speakers in [Root.GetName] have made no secret of what they think of our current rulership and political system. Speeches like these have tapped into a public dissent that is particularly pronounced in the more conservative sections of the military."

 fascism_on_the_rise.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a fascist coup."
 fascism_ideological_sympathies.t:0 "Fascist Sympathies in the Military"
 fascism_ideological_sympathies.d:0 "Several high-ranking members of the [Root.GetAdjective] military have expressed support, some privately and some openly, for the Fascist movement in [Root.GetName]. They feel the [Root.GetRulingParty] has forgotten how important force of arms is to keeping the country together, and are increasingly annoyed by the army being treated by the government as more of a tool than a one of the nation's most important institutions. Some of them go as far as to suggest that a new government is needed, one that knows how to lead [Root.GetName] into the next half of the century.\n\nThis faction may not predominantly be politicians, but some of them have gained positions in the department of defense. If these developments continue, they may have sufficient political support to execute a coup."
 fascism_ideological_sympathies.a:0 "The national spirit outranks the government."
 fascism_ideological_sympathies.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 fascism_coup.t:0 "Fascist Coup d'état"
 fascism_coup.d:0 "Some will say they saw it coming. Both those who warned against the dangers of fascism and those who extolled it as the savior of [Root.GetName] have found their prophecies made reality today, as the military in [Root.Capital.GetName] overthrew the [Root.GetRulingParty]-led government and seized power. [Root.GetLeader] is missing, rumored to have gone into exile, and the coup has been met with little initial resistance.\n\nThe new [Root.GetAdjective] leadership has no plans to allow resistance to grow, either. Martial law has been declared and with the changes that are underway, whatever comes after is unlikely to be very different."
 fascism_coup.a:0 "A strong state is needed to protect people from themselves."
 fascism_civil_war.t:0 "Civil War for Fascism"
 fascism_civil_war.d:0 "While the attempts of the fascist movement to revive nationalistic sentiment have seen some success, the resistance against these ideas remains high. The generals plotting to overthrow the current administration are disappointed in the lack of confidence the [Root.GetAdjective] population themselves seem to have in [Root.GetFascistParty].\n\nThey remain certain that the people will eventually tire of [Root.GetLeader], but are divided on what course of action to take. Some call for a coup to be executed now, before [Root.GetName]'s enemies take action. However, doing so while public support is limited would plunge the nation into civil war."
 fascism_civil_war.a:0 "The will to power is meaningless if one hesitates to seize it."
 fascism_civil_war.b:0 "They must unite the people first, then rule them."
 fascism_military_defections.t:0 "Fascist Assault Divisions Form"
 fascism_military_defections.d:0 "The political and the martial have always been intertwined in fascism. In parallel with its growing political movement, fascist parties have begun to form paramilitary organizations to protect against both internal and external threats, the internal threats being their political opponents. Although many people find this development worrying, the wave of militaristic furor has led to an increased amount of volunteers joining our armed forces.\n\nThe political leaders of the movement have pointed out that their opponents have reason to be afraid. Having the army permeated on several levels by so explicitly political elements, the enemies of [Root.GetName] and the enemies of fascism are beginning to look very much alike."
 fascism_military_defections.a:0 "Only traitors to the country have anything to fear."
 fascism_add_popularity.t:0 "The Threat of Communism"
 fascism_add_popularity.d:0 "'[Root.GetLeader] would have you believe [Root.GetName] stands safe and united. It is no surprise such lies have poisoned the minds of our people, when a snake is coiled up next door! Look no further than across our border to see countrymen having turned on each other in the name of communism, declaring the end of nations. How long until they declare our nation dead as well? Will the [Root.GetRulingParty] protect us from this threat?'\n\nThe growth of the fascist movement in [Root.GetName] has been bolstered by the proximity of the communist revolution. Many moderates who might normally dismiss fascism as another misguided ideological experiment find this to be a very real concern for them as well. Given the choice between the communism of our neighbors and a fascist regime, they would admittedly prefer the latter. They might even be willing to actively support it."
 fascism_add_popularity.a:0 "We will be the vanguard against the red threat!"
 democratic_on_the_rise.t:0 "Move Towards Democracy"
 democratic_on_the_rise.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state. They want the public involved in decision-making through referendums and local party meetings, even if this means risking the future of the current agenda."
 democratic_on_the_rise.a:0 "We can discuss this internally for a start."
 democratic_on_the_rise.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for arranging elections."
 democratic_on_the_rise.b:0 "Knowing we're in the right, we can afford allowing our enemies to talk more openly."

 democratic_ideological_sympathies.t:0 "[Root.GetRulingParty] Debates Democracy"
 democratic_ideological_sympathies.d:0 "Surprisingly, the call for more referendums and less repressive measures against opponents of the regime has received some support in internal party discussions. While [Root.GetRulingParty] leadership remains skeptical, several influential members have supported a shift.\n\nPerhaps they have confidence that little will change in practice, or perhaps they are secretly traitors to the party cause, as many of their opponents would have it. Regardless, if the public call for such changes should come, some of the leaders of [Root.GetName] are ready to compromise."
 democratic_ideological_sympathies.a:0 "The choice may not always stand between liberty and death."
 democratic_ideological_sympathies.a.tt:0 "The government may arrange elections when the policy has majority support."
 democratic_opposition_forming.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Forming"
 democratic_opposition_forming.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."
 democratic_opposition_forming.a:0 "The movement appears to grow naturally in the absence of of repression."
 democratic_call_for_elections.t:0 "Public Call for Elections"
 democratic_call_for_elections.d:0 "The demonstrations of public dissent which were once confined to limited areas are now widespread. While people gather in the streets, the [Root.GetRulingParty] finds itself at a crossroads. If we continue allowing this propaganda to spread, the referendums suggested both from within the party itself as well as the opposition may show that we do not have the support of the public. The unity we have strived for is giving way to a plurality of opinions, united against us."

 democratic_call_for_elections.b:0 "Let the people be heard."
 democratic_election.t:0 "Public Election in [Root.GetName]"
 democratic_election.d:0 "As freedom of expression and assembly have grown to become increasingly accepted in [Root.GetName], the faction within the [Root.GetRulingParty] calling for holding elections has gone from secret conspirators to publicly supported reformers. Despite [Root.GetLeader]'s protests, the country has been making a slow but steady move towards democracy for the past months and an election now seems like the natural next step.\n\nHowever, far from all [Root.GetAdjective] citizens are in favor of democratic reforms. There is still debate within the party regarding whether to wait holding the election until we can ensure a stable development."

However, it seems their public support has grown rapidly. Many fascists are now calling [Root.GetLeader] a hypocrite, claiming to represent the wishes of the people while in reality turning a deaf ear to the masses.\n\nThe call for a referendum has been dismissed as typical attempts at disrupting the system by [Root.GetRulingParty] members so far, but at least it's a political measure. If we do not act now, the fascists may choose the violent struggle as a better path to power."

The movement has spread outside political theory and into political practice, with disgruntled workers and even some high-profile celebrities voicing support. The communists call this class consciousness. The [Root.GetRulingParty] call it a fast track to riots and treason.\n\nShowing little faith in [Root.GetLeader] being willing to implement the reforms they demand, the more vocal communists have called for an immediate referendum to have the current government removed. While we might be able to reverse the momentum of this mass movement, failure to do so will doubtlessly result in the more popular communist method of removal: Revolution."

 democratic_fifty_percent.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the idea of the people ruling the nation they inhabit can easily grow very popular among the people. The [Root.GetRulingParty], of course, sees the idea of democracy as represented by these movements - freedom of speech, public elections, free press - merely populist rhetoric meant to weaken [Root.GetLeader]'s government.\n\nHowever, there is no denying those ideas have taken hold among the [Root.GetAdjective] population. In true democratic fashion, they call for a public referendum on replacing the current regime. Although currently easy to ignore, these ideas have a way of growing very persistent.

The working class, the supposed driving force of the revolution, has more pressing concerns than overthrowing [Root.GetLeader] and seem decidedly unimpressed with how well these revolutions have played out elsewhere. Meanwhile, the intellectuals who wrote passionate calls for slitting the throats of the oppressors have turned out to be surprisingly reluctant to instigate anything that might actually upset their comfortable lifestyle.\n\nTalk of the revolution will likely continue, whether over cheap beers or expensive wines, but it will likely be talk and nothing more."
