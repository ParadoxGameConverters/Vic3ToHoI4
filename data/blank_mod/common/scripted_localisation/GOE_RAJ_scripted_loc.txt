# Allows you to create your own dynamic keys
# to be called in localization.
# defined_text -> this is it, we're defining the text
# text -> a discrete entry that can be picked to display in loc.
# trigger -> determines if a text entry will be picked or not.
# (The triggers need to be valid for the scope the key is called in
# (eg Root or From.From).)
# localization_key -> points to the localization key
# that'll be used if trigger passes


##### Example #####

defined_text = {
	name = GetFamineTimeframe
	text = {
		trigger = {
			has_country_flag = reveal_true_famine_timeframe
		}
		localization_key = RAJ_famine_scripted_timeframe_reveal_desc
	}
	text = {
		trigger = {
			NOT = { has_country_flag = reveal_true_famine_timeframe }
		}
		localization_key = RAJ_famine_scripted_timeframe_non_reveal_desc
	}
}
