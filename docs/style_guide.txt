Coding Style
------------

The coding style for Vic3 to HoI4 is derived from the Google C++ Style Guide: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
Notable changes are longer line lengths and braced blocks starting on folloing lines.

Code formatting is enforced via clang format. There is a check on pull requests that will point out formatting errors, and they can be corrected via automated tools. In Visual Studio, select the relevant code (Ctrl + A will do the whole file), then press Ctrl+K,F to automatically format.

Naming should adhere to Google style as much as possible. This is enforced via clang-tidy. PR requests will fail on improper naming, and the clang-tidy configuration can be run locally to verify conformance.
